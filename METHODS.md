# Methods

## Overview

This project uses a statistical model to calculate offensive and defensive metrics for football national teams, based exclusively on historical data on match results; predict football match outcomes, on the basis of these metrics, using Monte Carlo simulations; and rank teams, based on these simulations. 

## Data Collection

The data is collected from publicly available sources, inspired by concepts from the Soccer Power Index (SPI), provided by FiveThirtyEight, until their project was paused in 2023. FiveThirtyEight's original SPI ranking from May 2021 is used as a starting point, and match results from that date onward are used with this project's method, to update offensive and defensive metrics and rankings.

## Model Explanation

## Clarification of Metrics

It is important to note that in this project, the terms "xG" and "xGA" are used to denote offensive and defensive metrics that represent the average goals scored and conceded by a team, respectively, over a given period. These metrics are adjusted for opponent strength and other factors, rather than being derived from shot-based probabilities.

This usage is distinct from the conventional football analytics metrics "expected goals" (xG) and "expected goals against" (xGA), which are calculated based on the quality and quantity of individual shots taken and faced by a team. The latter metrics estimate the likelihood of scoring from a given shot or conceding from a given shot, considering various contextual factors such as shot location, type, and assist type.

The approach in this project, of using adjusted averages, provides a straightforward and computationally efficient way to evaluate team performance over time, and is particularly useful in the context of simulating match outcomes and ranking teams.

### Offensive and Defensive Metrics (xG and xGA)
- **Offensive (xG) and Defensive (xGA) Metrics**: These metrics represent the average goals for and against each team, respectively.
  
- **Reward Factor**: Goals are weighted based on the initial SPI ranking of the opponent. The reward factor multiplies goals scored by 2 times the opponent team's SPI divided by the 25th percentile SPI. This effectively weights goals from the lowest ranked team to the highest roughly as the 95th percentile max goals per match, scored in the period (6).
  
- **Levelling Factor**: This is necessary because without this factor, low ranked teams get their goals against high ranked teams rewarded, but all goals against them are practically nullified. The levelling factor ensures that low ranked teams are rewarded for scoring against high ranked teams, but in a balanced manner. This factor implies subtracting 2 times the median SPI divided by the scoring team's SPI. The factor parallels the reward factor, but still allowing lower ranked teams to be rewarded for scoring against higher ranked teams.
  
- **Low SPI Teams Matches**: The code separates matches between teams that both have an SPI under the 25th percentile, to avoid creating xG and xGA metrics that give too much importance to these matches. Goals against in such matches are set to 6 (95th percentile goals scored per match) and goals for to 1/6, the inverse of the 95th percentile. This means that teams under the 25th percentile must play and get good results against teams ranked above the 25th percentile, in order to make progress in the ranking. This avoids that teams that only play teams in the bottom of the ranking get unfairly high offensive and unfairly low defensive metrics. This also reflects practice, where low ranked teams climb in rankings when playing and getting good results against higher ranked teams.
  
### Considerations for Weighting Goals in xG and xGA Calculations

In the calculation of offensive (xG) and defensive (xGA) metrics, goals are weighted based on the opponent's Soccer Power Index (SPI), for the reward factor, and the scoring teamâ€™s SPI, for the leveling factor. This approach was chosen, for several reasons:

1. **Comprehensive Measure**: SPI is a combined measure of a team's offensive and defensive capabilities. By using SPI, the model accounts for the overall strength and dynamics of the team, rather than isolating offensive or defensive metrics.

2. **Dynamic Interactions**: Football matches are complex, with dynamic interactions between a team's offensive and defensive strengths. A team with a strong offense can indirectly bolster its defense, by maintaining control of the game. Using SPI helps capture these interactions, providing a holistic view of team strength.

3. **Simplicity and Consistency**: Using SPI simplifies the calculations, making the model more straightforward and easier to understand. It ensures consistency in how goals are weighted across different matches.

### Alternative Approach Considered

An alternative approach considered was to calculate the reward factor, based on the opponent's defensive metrics, and the leveling factor, based on the scoring team's offensive metrics. While this might seem to offer more precision, by specifically targeting each team's strengths and weaknesses, it was decided against for the following reasons:

- **Dynamic Complexity**: A team's defensive strength can be influenced by its offensive capabilities and vice versa. By using separate metrics, the model might miss out on capturing these interdependencies.
- **Over-Simplification**: Using only defensive metrics for the reward factor might oversimplify the evaluation, not fully acknowledging the combined effect of a team's overall strength as reflected in the SPI.

By prioritizing a combined measure through SPI, the model aims to balance precision with a comprehensive view of team dynamics. This decision ensures that both offensive and defensive strengths are considered, reflecting a truer nature of football matches.

### Monte Carlo Simulations
The Monte Carlo simulation method is used to predict match outcomes by running thousands of simulations for each match.

1. **Inverse Poisson Distribution with 10,000 random numbers**: This method is employed to simulate the number of goals scored in 10,000 matches between two teams at a time. The Monte Carlo simulations employ a univariate Poisson distribution to estimate the goal probabilities for each team. This process is informed by the expected goals for each team.
   
2. **Expected Goals Calculation**: The multiplicative method is used to calculate expected goals based on offensive and defensive metrics, factored by the median goals scored. Expected goals work as lambda for the Poisson distributions, obtained with random numbers and inverse Poisson. The multiplicative approach is borrowed from disciplines such as [psychology](https://dictionary.apa.org/multiplicative-model), where multiplicative factors are considered more dynamic than additive ones, allowing for better interaction between offensive and defensive strengths. The multiplicative method is assumed to capture the complexities and interactions within the game more effectively than an additive approach.
   
3. **Simulation Runs**: Each match is simulated 10,000 times to ensure robustness of the predictions.
   
4. **Calculation of Soccer Power Index (SPI)**: Paralleling the concept developed by FiveThirtyEight, the Soccer Power Index (SPI) is calculated as the percentage of available points a team would get through the match simulations, when all teams play against all. Available points are 3 for wins and 1 for ties, for (n-1) available teams.
   
5. **Ranking based on SPI**: Teams are ranked from high to low, based on SPI. Most of the time, a higher ranked team in terms of SPI will beat a lower ranked team in terms of SPI in the simulations. However, this relationship is not completely linear. Therefore, the project also includes a Streamlit-app, to simulate individual matchups.
   
6. **Streamlit-app to simulate matchups**: The Streamlit app is available <a href="https://footballpredictor.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">here</a>. This app uses the same methodology, based on random numbers, inverse Poisson and expected goals. The starting point for the simulation is the offensive and defensive metrics in the team ranking. Each offensive and defensive metric is presented, factored by the median of goals scored by all teams in each match, during the given period.
    
7. **Hypothesis testing in the Streamlit-app**: The null hypothesis is that a simulated match ends up in a tie, which is roughly equivalent to an equal amount of wins, ties and losses in the 10,000 simulations, or [3333,3333,3334] (and permutations). The chi-squared statistic is used to test for significantly different results. If the simulations render a distribution that is significantly different from a tie, the team with most wins is chosen as a winner.
    
8. **Forecast Result**: The most frequent score for the selected outcome with hypothesis testing is used in the forecast result. Note that the differences in frequencies between possible results are often small, and probably not significant. The forecast will therefore not be significantly confident, but it is a starting point. It will generally be useful to see different possible and probable scores, intepret these results, and consider the effect of other external variables. Rather than the diagonal inflated bivariate Poisson regression to estimate the probability of different scores, [purportedly used by FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-brazils-world-cup-to-lose/), the approach in this project is to calculate univariate Poisson distributions for each team. This is used to compare scores. Additionally, the univariate Poisson distributions are used to calculate a joint Poisson distribution, for alternative scores. In this approach, the probability of each score is calculated as the joint probability of each team's score, `p1 * p2`, treating the scores as independent events. But this does not mean that the probabilities are completely independent, considering that the adjusted expected goals already account for interactions between the opposing teams' offensive and defensive ratings. This method simplifies the comparison of team strengths, introducing less complexity and reducing potential biases from additional parameters.
   
Some critics may argue that not using the bivariate inflated Poisson model can give undue importance to ties, as referenced in [Karlis and Ntzoufras (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9884.00366), who noted that using a bivariate Poisson distribution can improve model fit and the prediction of the number of draws in football games. However, even when the [suitability of the bivariate Poisson is demonstrated](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43965722), it is not evident that this is necessarily better in practice, than using univariate Poisson models, which have also [been demonstrated as a good approximation for football scores](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9574.1982.tb00782.x), and then calculating a joint distribution, as suggested in this project's approach. Therefore, the simplicity and transparency of the univariate Poisson approach are prioritized here. When predicting individual matchups, ties are addressed through significance testing, as explained above, to ensure the robustness and reliability of the predictions.

### Rationale for Using Univariate Poisson Models

The model employs univariate Poisson distributions for modeling the number of goals scored by each team, rather than the diagonal inflated bivariate Poisson regression. This decision is based on several considerations:

1. **Complexity and Assumptions**: Bivariate Poisson models introduce a correlation parameter to capture interdependencies between the number of goals scored by two teams. However, the direction and magnitude of this correlation are not always straightforward and can vary depending on match context, team strategies, and other factors. According to [Karlis and Ntzoufras, 2003](http://www2.stat-athens.aueb.gr/~karlis/Bivariate%20Poisson%20Regression.pdf), "empirical evidence shows small and not significant correlation (usually less than 0.05)", they go on to say that "even so small correlation can have impact to the results", but it is unclear why this should be "more realistic", when we do not know the exact direction and form of the proposed correlation.

2. **Dynamic Nature of Football**: The dynamics within a football match are complex and not easily captured by simple correlations. Teams might change their strategies based on the match situation, player conditions, and tactical decisions. Introducing a correlation parameter might overcomplicate the model, without necessarily improving its predictive power.

3. **Simplicity and Transparency**: Treating the number of goals scored by each team as independent events simplifies the model and makes it more transparent. This approach focuses on the core probabilistic events without adding layers of assumptions that may not be supported by empirical data. This priorizes the attitude summarized in the motto "plurality should not be posited without necessity", often referred to as [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor)

4. **Empirical Evidence**: Simple Poisson models have been demonstrated as a good approximation for football scores (Maher, 1982). While some studies suggest that bivariate Poisson models can improve fit and prediction of draws (Karlis & Ntzoufras, 2003), the empirical advantage of such models over simpler ones is not always clear-cut. Additionally, [Karlis and Ntzoufras (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9884.00366) acknowledge that the inflated bivariate Poisson model introduces overdispersion as well. Introducing overdispersion adds another layer of complexity and requires robust empirical data to estimate accurately, which may not always be available. Karlis and Ntzoufras (2003) note that "real data show small overdispersion" and that "the overdispersion is negligible especially if covariates are included."

By prioritizing simplicity and transparency, the model aims to provide robust and interpretable predictions without introducing unnecessary complexity. When predicting individual matchups, ties are addressed through significance testing, as explained above, to ensure the robustness and reliability of the predictions.

## Interpretations and Limitations
- **Number of matches by team in historical data:** The model does not consider the number of matches played by team, and does not reward teams that qualify to later phases of tournaments. The result is that teams who do not qualify to final phases (like Mali, who did not qualify to the World Cup 2022, or Russia, who played fewer competitive matches, due to a ban since 2022), might have a strong rating, but based on fewer matches. However, this does not mean that the ranking of these teams is necessarily wrong. If other teams really are better, because they have qualified and played more matches, this will reflect in the statistics in the long run. But care has to be taken when looking at a snapshot of this process, and when trying to forecast individual matches between teams that have more or less amount of historical data in the ranking. 

- **External factors:** The model does not consider other external factors that might affect the outcome of matches. Such external factors can include home advantage, changes in team management, injuries and similar. These factors would considerably complicate the model, introducing bias and less availability of data. When interpreting results, it is therefore crucial to consider the possible effects that these factors can have for individual match ups.

- **Fair consideration of low- and mid-tier teams:** The model is based on a theoretical assumption that all teams get to play all teams. In practice, this is not the case, and it is unlikely that very low-ranked teams get to play very high-ranked teams. Therefore, the model corrects for low-ranked teams, under the 25th percentile, that mostly play low-ranked teams, under the 25th percentile. The purpose of this correction is to avoid rewarding very low-ranked teams unfairly, with too low defensive metrics, that would inevitably result from the low weight given to the scores of the low-ranked opponents. This is a problem when low-ranked teams play mostly low-ranked teams. Because we never get to know how many goals these low-ranked teams would get from higher-ranked teams. A similar correction might be necessary for mid-tier teams that mostly play mid-tier teams. These teams might get an unfairly low defensive score, compared to higher ranked teams, because goals scored by other mid-tier teams to mid-tier teams are weighted lower. And we would not know how many goals these teams might get from higher ranked teams. This might be the reason why teams like Mali, who have not qualified to the World Cup 2022 and gotten to play other high-ranked, besides teams like Morocco, gets such a good ranking in 2024. But this correction is less necessary with mid-tier teams, just as long as these teams do get to play top-ranked teams. If they do have a worse defense, they would get relatively many goals against weighted higher. Mid-tier teams play top-ranked teams more often than low-ranked teams. And just as long as these teams have not played top-ranked teams, it is harder to know how well they would perform. This is the reason no correction is introduced for mid-tier teams. However, it is important to always read the rankings and predictions in light of the underlying historical match data for each team.
